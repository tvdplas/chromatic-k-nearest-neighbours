abstract={A mode of a multiset S is an element aâˆˆS of maximum multiplicity; that is, a occurs at least as frequently as any other element in S. Given an array A[1:n] of n elements, we consider a basic problem: constructing a static data structure that efficiently answers range mode queries on A. Each query consists of an input pair of indices (i,j) for which a mode of A[i:j] must be returned. The best previous data structure with linear space, by Krizanc, Morin, and Smid (Proceedings of the International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), pp.517--526, 2003), requires {\$}{\backslash}varTheta ({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\backslash}log{\backslash}log n){\$}query time in the worst case. We improve their result and present an O(n)-space data structure that supports range mode queries in {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n/{\backslash}log n{\}}){\$}worst-case time. In the external memory model, we give a linear-space data structure that requires {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n/B{\}}){\$}I/Os per query, where B denotes the block size. Furthermore, we present strong evidence that a query time significantly below {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}cannot be achieved by purely combinatorial techniques; we show that boolean matrix multiplication of two {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}} {\backslash}times {\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}matrices reduces to n range mode queries in an array of size O(n).},
